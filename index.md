title: Welcome to Lumen's Note
---

Hi, I'm Lumen. I'm a Robotic Software Engineering right now working at Agile Robots.

## What is this site?

This small space serves as the primary platform for sharing my public notes. In the past, I've experimented with different setups: first with my WordPress blog (now private), then my [xlog blog](https://xlog.lumeny.io/), and later my [personal website](https://writings.lumeny.io/) built with Hexo. However, each of these fell short of meeting my expectations in one way or another. Now I find Quartz, which satisfies nearly all my criteria for an ideal blogging tool - a simple editing process and has the added benefit of helping me gradually develop a well-interconnected knowledge base.

Whether it's short notes or long-form writing, I firmly believe that creating output is the first step in ensuring I've truly learned something. Inspired by [Ellie Huxtable](https://ellie.wtf/), I've adopted a structure that organizes my posts into four categories:

1. [Posts](/posts) for long-form essays and in-depth writing,
2. [Projects](/projects) for anything related to ongoing or completed work,
3. [Life](/life) for personal reflections and experiences,
4. [Notes](/notes) for shorter, more frequent updates capturing my daily explorations and discoveries.

Additionally, I also write short notes on the interesting paper I read/or acedemic materials at [Papers](/papers) directory, I hope those knowledge can be systematically accumulated, give me insights into the research fields I'm curious at. 

This content structure encompasses everything I might want to share without restricting me to only polished or meticulously crafted pieces. In fact, the pursuit of perfection can often drain the joy out of blogging, and I shall definitely avoid this trap.
