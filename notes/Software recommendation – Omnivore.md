It has been night days since I tried out the Omnivore and I am falling in love with it. It is an open-source read-it-later software that has very complete functionaility and very good design. From my user experience, I didn’t experience anything inconvenient/unconfortable when trying to incorporate it into my workflow. Although I’ve only used Omnivore for night days, it has already brought huge value to me, which I would like to write about now.

I use rss to collect information from many different sources, sources from esteemed press like Scientific American to personal blogs of other people. Most of the time I have hunderds of feeds in the inbox and I can’t savour on one particular article in face of many potentially interesting contents left undiscoverd.

Let me be honest, while finding those good writer’s and opinions is suppose to be enjoyable, **the joy quickly becomes mental burden unless you can’t find time processing them**. As more feeds coming in everyday, the load piles up and eventually ruin my desire to have a look at those long articles.

Omnivore serves as a good tool to allow me review those valuable blog/articles easily after I’ve collected them.

But I don’t read them much because there is always something new coming and I often don’t have large chunks of time to sit down specifically for the article reading. **In retrospect, I would say collecting good information should be a seperated process from processing them** and I used to
